          Refund Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          At the time of raising a request for return or cancelling the Products
          on the apkaBazzar Platform, you may seek a refund. Such refund will be
          made to you only in the event the payment has been received by us for
          the Product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be informed that when you opt to cancel or return the Products,
          upon our verification and assessment of the Products and the documents
          relating thereto, the refund amount for such Products which are
          eligible for return as per the terms of this Policy, will be processed
          within 48 (forty-eight) hours from the date of us receiving the
          returned Product back at our warehouse. Your refund will be processed
          only when the conditions, as stipulated by us, are fulfilled, such as
          the Product being returned in its original condition, along with the
          price tag intact, including the original packaging of the Product, the
          brand outer packaging of the damaged or defective or inaccurate
          Product, and all accessories therein are intact. For the sake of
          abundant clarity, it is clarified that we shall not make any refund in
          respect of a Product that is deemed ineligible for a refund based on
          our verification and assessment. The refund amount will be credited to
          the original payment mode opted by you or given as Store credit to
          you. You acknowledge that after initiation of a refund, it may take
          additional time for your refund to reflect in your account, which is
          subject to your financial institution or payment solution provider
          terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do not make any cash refunds. The amount will be refunded to you
          within 7 (seven) working days into the original mode of payment chosen
          by you. Sometimes banks or financial intermediaries take a longer time
          to process the refund request. However, if the refund does not happen
          by the date advised, you may contact us, and we will gladly help you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Refund to be made to the User shall not include any amount paid
          towards shipping charges or any other such charges applicable from
          time to time. However, in the event a Product has been delivered with
          a defect or damage (for reasons attributable to, and accepted by us
          after due verification at its sole discretion), we may refund the
          shipping charges to you. You will be provided with a refund if you
          have received a non-returnable Product in a damaged or defective
          condition subject to verification and examination of the damage or
          defect of the Product by us.
        </p>

        <p>
          We provide a refund for few scenarios such as Product for replacement
          is not available with us or for Products that were incorrectly
          represented on the website. We reserve the right to reject a refund
          request for a Product if it does not satisfy the quality conditions
          specified under this Policy on our assessment pursuant to its return.
          We may, in such cases, notify you and send the returned Product back
          without initiating a refund.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brand Approved (exceptional returns) approved by the Brand within the
          warranty period of the product, there may be issues posting a refund
          if the transaction is over 180 days old. For such cases, our team will
          reach out to you for documents to post a manual refund into an
          alternate account. The user is mandatorily required to submit a copy
          of his/her bank account details (such as Cancelled Cheque, Bank
          Passbook) along with photo ID proof (such as PAN card, Aadhar card).
          All the documents submitted should be in the same name as the Billing
          name used while placing the order. For cases where thereâ€™s a mismatch
          in name, apkaBazzar reserves the right to refuse the user's refund to
          a bank account and will process the refund as Store Credit only.
